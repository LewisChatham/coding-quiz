## Description
My motivation for building this coding-quiz were to work on my use of dynamic content and local storage.
It serves to test peoples technical knowledge.
For future versions i would allow people to add questions without having to edit the source code.
I learnt a lot about conditional statements withing elements that have been dynamically generated.

## Usage
To use the quiz, open up the webpage and click the button "Start Quiz"
From here, you have 75 seconds on a timer (seen top right) to answer 5 questions about web development.
You answer the question by clicking the button that contains the answer.
If you get the question wrong, 10 seconds will be removed from your time.
The quiz ends if you answer all the questions or you run out of time.
You can save highscores if you successfully make it to the end.
